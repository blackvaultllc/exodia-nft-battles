            You must be 18 years of age or the age of majority in your jurisdiction to register,
            purchase digital items, or trade on the platform. Accounts are non-transferable. We may

            Digital cards, packs, boxes, and NFT relics ("Digital Items") are collectibles intended
            for entertainment. They are not investment instruments, securities, or guarantees of
            future value. We make no promise of resale value, liquidity, or market demand.

        <Section id="purchases" title="2. Purchases & Refunds">
          <p>
            All purchases of Digital Items, mint packs, mint boxes, EXOD token bundles, and the Duel
            Pass subscription are <strong>final and non-refundable</strong> once the item has been
            delivered or the pack has been opened. Subscriptions may be cancelled at any time and
            will remain active through the end of the paid period.

            Card rolls are executed server-side using cryptographically seeded randomness. Outcomes
            cannot be predicted or altered by clients. Owner-only and reserved cards are excluded

        <Section id="tokens" title="4. EXOD Utility & In-Game Currency">
          <p>
            EXOD is an in-game utility credit used to open packs, buy boxes, and trade on the
            marketplace. EXOD has no monetary value off-platform, is not redeemable for cash, and
            may be adjusted, capped, or expired to preserve game economy health (e.g. the 1,000 EXOD
            per-day level-up cap, the 5-pack credit cap, the 30-second anti-farming cooldown).

          <p>
            Disputes will first be addressed through good-faith support correspondence. Unresolved
